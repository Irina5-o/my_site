# Portfolio Website (Django)

This is a Django-based portfolio website for a junior Python programmer. It includes a main app for your content, and is ready for you to add your projects, skills, and contact information.

## How to run the project

1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already active):
   
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

2. Run the Django development server:
   
   ```powershell
   C:/Users/Ira/visualcodestudio/.venv/Scripts/python.exe manage.py runserver
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Next steps
- Add your HTML templates in `main/templates/`
- Add your CSS files in `main/static/`
- Customize the `main/views.py` and `portfolio/urls.py` to display your portfolio content.
